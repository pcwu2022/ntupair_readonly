            <b>Welcome to NTU Pair, a platform designed to couple up NTU students who share the same value or have similar interests!</b>

            Our seek for the perfect match begins by answering several questions. 
            By doing the tests, our system can collect information about your personality and use these data to find those with similar traits. 
            After filling out the forms, you can choose which data to be used in the matching process, and which types of data to be selected from the database.
            With the integration of our chatbox interface, our system provides instant messaging service for you to chat with those on your match list. 
            You can make message requests, approve or decline others' requests on your free will.
            Test, match, chat, and get engaged, NTU Pair is always the best choice for you.
            <br><br>
